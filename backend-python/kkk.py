  2. ER Model
1. It is a high level data model based on a perception of a real world that consists of a collection of basic objects, calledentities and of relationships        
 among these objects.
2. Graphical representation of ER Model is ER diagram, which acts as a blueprint of DB.
LEC-3: Entity-Relationship Model
1. Data Model: Collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency
constraints.
2. ER Model
5. e.g., Customer borrow loan, loan has total participation as it canâ€™t exist without customer entity. And
customer has partial participation.
6. Weak entity has total participation constraint, but strong
 may not have total.
